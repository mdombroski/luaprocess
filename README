Useful Lua functions for managing processes

To try this Lua library, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua and
run make. This will build procname.so and run a simple test. If everything is
ok, install procname.so in some official place.

Files in this package:
  procname.c      procname library
  test.lua        test code

Usage:
	process.setname( name )
	process.getname( )
	fork( )
	wait( [number] )
	exec( program, [arg,...] )
