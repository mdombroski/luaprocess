This Lua library lets you easily rename your Lua programs in top and ps output.

To try this Lua library, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua and
run make. This will build procname.so and run a simple test. If everything is
ok, install procname.so in some official place.

Files in this package:
  procname.c      procname library
  test.lua        test code

Usage:
> require "procname"
> print( procname.get() )
lua
> procname.set( "new name" )
> print( procname.get()
new name
>
